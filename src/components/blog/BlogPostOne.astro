            Every brilliant design starts with an amazing idea, as well as
            hundreds of not-so-amazing ones. To the user’s eye, these rejected
            concepts aren’t at all visible, however, their experience would be
            nowhere near as delightful if mistakes, iterations, and learnings
            didn’t happen during the design process.
          </p><blockquote>
            “Ideation is the mode of the design process in which you concentrate
            on idea generation. Mentally, it represents a process of “going
            wide” in terms of concepts and outcomes. Ideation provides both the
            fuel and also the source material for building prototypes and
            getting innovative solutions into the hands of your users.” —

          <h3>Why ideation is so important</h3><p>
            Whether doing so intentionally or not, we go through a multitude of
            ideation processes daily. What takeaway should we get? What train
            should I catch? What should we do on the weekend?
